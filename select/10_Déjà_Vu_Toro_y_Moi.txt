Lord, have mercy, child
What do you want?
What do you need right now?
I think I'm free, but I'm tied down
Maybe it's greed to take what's found
A Wounded Knee that came unwound
Anesthesia, please knock me out

Déjà vu in a town like this
Only simply makes me miss
Everything all about you
Everything that we would do

Do dirty dancing in a tiny town
Red, white and blue
Black and brown
No romancing, don't you mess around
A sweet taboo and you made a vow (Mmm, yes, sir)

Déjà vu in a town like this
Only simply makes me miss
Everything all about you
Everything that we would do
