Sorry now I'm a sailer into the water
Give me a dollar, pass the sea of (Hora?)
Don't close your eyes from fear
Don't close your eyes

Sorry then you'll wonder how you can enter
Give me a dollar, I'll give you a key to the door
Don't close your eyes from fear
(Don't close your eyes)

Deja vu Don't you wanna see?
Deja vu Don't you want to freeze it?

Remember you put numbers by the computer?
Give me a dollar, hack the code of the numbers
You're so high I'm walking on air (you're so high)

Remember you wonder how you're supposed to feel
Give me a dollar, I'll show you a hint of the answer
You're so high I'm walking on air (you're so high)

Deja vu Don't you wanna see?
Deja vu Don't you want to freeze it?

I had to (digitally modify?) my former self
I was a (feeling lifted?) kind of
I read the last page of Nabokov
I fell asleep like black cat on my chair
Grandma next door had a cough
Did you hear some one yell turn it off?
All I could see was lights off
Expectations of humankind

Is it real or is it dream? I want to move my world Is it real or is it dream? Goddamn deja vu got me dizzy
Goddamn crazy life got me busy
The world is unfair it's so hazy
Smoke it like, crackle up, play some 50 Cent
Shake me up, cause nothing makes sense
Give it like, where's my sixth sense
Can you feel the sound of
Expectations of humankind

Is it real or is it dream? I want to move my world Is it real or is it dream? I wanna move my world
I wanna move my body
I wanna move, you

Deja vu Don't you wanna see?
Deja vu Don't you want to freeze it?
