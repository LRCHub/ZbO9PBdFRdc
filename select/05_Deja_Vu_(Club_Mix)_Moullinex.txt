Deja vu, deja vu
Deja vu, deja vu

Lonely girls don't leave me now running round the things
You don't wanna hear
Deja vu and all the things I do
Don't call me I call you
Deja vu
I'm having such a deja vu and i know that you have it too

Deja vu deja vu
Deja vu deja vu

Missing the blues even if you're alone in here
Your shine is () stop it, you're killing this dance
Deja vu and all the things you do
Don't call me I call you
Deja vu
I'm having such a deja vu and i know that you have it too

(Interm)

Missing the Blues even if you're alone in here
You shine () is stop it, your're killing this dance
Deja vu and all the things you doom
Don't call me I call you
Deja vu
I'm having such a deja vu and i know that you have it

Deja Vu and all the things I doom
Don't call me I call you
Deja vu
I'm having such a deja vu and i know that you have it too
