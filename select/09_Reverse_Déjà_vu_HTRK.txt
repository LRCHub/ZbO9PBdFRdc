I recognise this feeling, so untrue
You're acting like a reverse déjà vu
And how can I bury you

In my mind
It was a different time
With a different point of view
And I find
I recognise this feeling, so untrue
You're acting like a reverse déjà vu
And how can I bury you

In my mind
It was a different time
With a different point of view
And I find
I recognise these feelings, so untrue
Ah I didn't see this coming
Nor did you
You're acting like a reverse déjà vu
And how can I
And how can I
Bury you
