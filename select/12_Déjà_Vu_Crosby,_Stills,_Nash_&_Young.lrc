[00:30.27] Four
[00:32.27] 
[00:37.84] If I had ever been here before
[00:39.14] I would probably know just what to do
[00:40.65] Don't you?
[00:45.65] 
[00:46.73] If I had ever been here before on another time around the wheel
[00:48.02] I would probably know just how to deal

[01:10.33] Like I've been here before
[01:16.17] Feel
[01:22.07] Like I've been here before
[01:28.38] And you know it makes me wonder
[01:36.65] What's going on under the ground

[04:04.58] 
[03:56.15] We have all been here before
[04:01.87] We have all been here before
